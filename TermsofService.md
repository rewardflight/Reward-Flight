By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be governed by these Terms and Conditions. If You disagree with any portion of these Terms and Conditions, you may not use the Service.

## Other Website’s Links
Our Service may contain connections to third-party web sites or services that the Company does not own or control. The Company has no ties to any airlines or mileage programs.
The Company has no control over, and accepts no responsibility for, any third-party web sites or services' content, privacy policies, or practices. You also acknowledge and agree that the Company is not liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such content, goods, or services available on or through any such web sites or services.
We highly recommend that You read the terms and conditions as well as the privacy policies of any third-party web sites or services that You access.
## Termination
We reserve the right to cancel or suspend Your access at any time, without prior warning or responsibility, for any reason, including, without limitation, if You violate these Terms and Conditions.
Your right to use the Service will be terminated immediately upon termination.

## Data Reliability
The Service makes use of data that is obtained and processed on a regular basis from various airlines or mileage programs. The Service only shows cached data, which may be out of date when You access it. Inadvertently, the Service may misread or omit availability.
You shall not depend only on the Service for information before deciding to transfer or acquire points, make travel reservations, or take any other action. The Service cannot also prevent or identify "phantom" availability, which is availability that may not exist even if both the Service and the relevant airline or mileage program claim it is.
You must not rely solely on the Service's alerting features for information. The alerting functions may encounter disruptions, outages, or become momentarily unable to get fresh availability from specific airlines or mileage programs. The alerting features use the same data as the Website and are vulnerable to the same possible phantom availability concerns.

## Data Utilization
You may access the Service in a non-automated manner for either non-commercial or commercial purposes at no cost (unless you want to subscribe to a premium plan). You do not require authorization to use the Service  for commercial purposes in a non-automated manner.
The company also provides application programming interfaces (APIs) that are consumed automatically. You must not utilize the APIs or their related data for commercial purposes without the prior approval of the Company. You may use the APIs for personal reasons that are not commercial in nature without expense or specific authorization as long as your usage is not commercial in nature and you credit the data as required below.
All application programming interfaces (APIs) users must credit any replicated data to Reward Flight in a reasonable and visible manner.

## Prohibited Applications
We do not allow resellers of frequent flyer points or miles (such as "mileage brokers") to utilize the Service. If, in our sole judgement, we think that you are being compensated for the redemption or transfer of miles or points, we may restrict you from using the Service or cancel your account to the Service without return or prior notice. We may also cancel your account if we feel you are violating or assisting in the violation of the conditions of an airline or mileage program, if we suspect you are exploiting airlines or mileage program(s) in any other way we judge, or for any other cause authorized by these conditions.

## Individually Identifiable Information (III)
We shall only use or disclose your Individually identifiable information (III) to provide you with this Service and to run our business as the Company deems reasonable. For example, in order to give you an alert, we may share your email address with an email delivery provider.
We and our partners may collect usage and product analytics (via Google Analytics and other technologies) and maintain server logs during routine Website use to assist diagnose and administer the Service. We may send you product updates and other relevant Service announcements via email.

## Subscription to Pro
Reward Flight provides a Pro membership for £5 GBP per month or £29.00 GBP per year, processed and handled by iTunes/Google Play accounts. Pro membership customers may look for extended availability on supported routes up to 365 days in advance using the search tool. All Pro features are subject to change.
The Pro subscription is non-refundable and can be discontinued at any time. Extended availability refreshes significantly slower than regular availability, which is published for free on the site. Routes with extended availability are subject to change at any time. Pro features are provided on a best-effort basis and may encounter disruptions, as described under Data Reliability.
Subscriptions to Pro may be used for business purposes, but they may not be shared or utilized automatically. We have the right to suspend or delete accounts that violate this policy without refund.

## Liability Restriction
Regardless of any damages You may incur, the Company's and any of its suppliers' entire liability under any provision of these Terms, and Your sole remedy for all of the foregoing, shall be limited to the amount actually paid by You through the Service, or £100 GBP if You haven't purchased anything through the Service.
To the greatest extent permitted by applicable law, neither the Company nor its suppliers shall be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages of any kind (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, business interruption, personal injury, or loss of privacy) arising out of or in any way connected with the use or inability to use the Service, third-party software, and/or third-party hardware.

## The Terms of Severability and Waiver Severability
If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be amended and construed to achieve the purposes of that section to the maximum degree practicable under applicable law, while the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.

## Waiver
Except as expressly stated herein, a party's failure to exercise a right or require performance of an obligation under these Terms shall not affect that party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.

## Modifications to These Terms and Conditions
We retain the right to amend or replace these Terms at any moment in Our sole discretion. If the adjustment is significant, we shall make reasonable attempts to offer at least 30 days' notice before any new terms take effect. What constitutes a substantial change shall be determined only by Us.
You agree to be bound by the amended terms by continuing to access or use Our Service after such adjustments become effective. If You do not agree to the amended terms in their whole or in part, please discontinue use of the website and the Service.
